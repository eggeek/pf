To compile: make fast
To debug: make dev
To clean: make clean

Once compiled, run ./build/<dev|fast>/bin/warthog for a list of command line parameters. 
A simple case is the following:

./bin/warthog --scen <scen file> --map <map file> --alg <alg name>

Where map files are end with '.map', and scen file are end with '.scen'.

Algorithms are:
  - '--alg jps2': JPS with block based scanning
  - '--alg jps2-prune2': Constrained JPS

For ablation study, checkout following branches:
  - 'feature/constrained-jps': CJPS
  - 'jps2-b1': backwards scanning on JPS
  - 'jps2-g1': diagonal caching on JPS
  - 'c2jps2-b1': backwards scanning on CJPS
  - 'c2jps2-g1': diagonal caching on CJPS
